### Actively Updated 🆕
- Apollo Crack
- Erika
- Ishtar (upcoming generic cracker for certain things...)
- Satella / Satella Jailed
- StarForge (upcoming)
- Violyn

### To-Do List 🗒
- 「StarForge」      Successor to KOTOR 1 Mod Manager, will include K2 support
- 「Satella Jailed」 Register for app start notifications instead of hardcoded time to add SatellaWindow
- 「PaiBloxx」       Look into porting this to TrollStore
- 「Violyn」         Optimise the UI for respective platforms
- 「Erika」          Fix bugs in Sileo, maybe add ErikaWindow to Saily
- 「Reverie」        Try to add requested features, i.e., muting alarms and throttling CPU
- 「Butterfly」      SwiftUI status bar. May or may not bother finishing (at least not soon)

### Can you make a tweak/crack something for me?
Used to do this sometimes, but I have a lot going on and decreasing amounts of free-time, so custom  requests are currently unavailable. Exception is for fixing bugs in the tweaks listed under "Actively Updated"
