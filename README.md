### About Me
Just a random iOS hacker who really (凄く) loves Emilia. I also like the When They Cry series, DDLC, and black tea. Almost everything you'll see here is related to tweak development for iOS 13-14. Also, here is a red truth for you:

### Contact Me
- [u/paisseon](https://reddit.com/u/paisseon) on Reddit
- EMT#8454 on Discord ([join CyPwn!](https://discord.gg/cZ2gBRZvwW))

Those are the two places where I actually see messages. GitHub issues don't give me notifications so I don't see/respond usually. Please understand that due to work, college, and possible timezone differences I may respond at weird times or after a long delay.

### Currently in Development
- \[All Tweaks] Depictions for non-Sileo package managers. Thanks to Bryce!
- \[Argyle] Possibly cancelled or delayed. Debra on [Sudo's repo](https://sudocat-dev.github.io/repo) is really good, use it.
- \[CCCalc] Make a better fix with less bugs, I suppose.
- \[CustomPass] Initial release. It lets you choose whatever symbols you want for the passcode. Does not actually change passcode, just the symbols.
- \[CyDown++] Fix Cydia on arm64e devices.
- \[DarkKeysReborn] Full rewrite, probably won't add anything new but the code was awful.
- \[Logos] Initial release. A definition of Objective-C/Logos for the Nova text editor.
- \[Pandora] Initial release. A video wallpaper tweak written in Swift/Orion.
- \[Raida] Initial release. Enable Apple's built-in multitasking features on iPhone.
- \[Reverie] Actively updated but nothing WIP.
- \[Satella] Possibly sandbox the receipt faker so it crashes less.
- \[Vivy] Actively updated but nothing WIP.
