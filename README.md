### Contact Me
- [u/paisseon](https://reddit.com/u/paisseon) on Reddit
- EMT#0001 on Discord ([join CyPwn!](https://discord.gg/cZ2gBRZvwW))

Those are the two places where I actually see messages. GitHub issues don't give me notifications so I don't see/respond usually. **I'm doing finals through 17 December, so please be patient with long delays**

### Future Tweaks and Updates
- \[Chocola 1.1] Performance improvements maybe? Kinda needs it, but I wanted that Christmas day release :p
- \[Erika 1.0] It's literally 0.5b renamed, but it's open source now!
- \[Satella Legacy 2.8] Legacy version is exactly the same except it doesn't crash iOS 12 preferences
