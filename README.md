### Contact Me
- [u/paisseon](https://reddit.com/u/paisseon) on Reddit
- EMT#0001 on Discord ([join CyPwn!](https://discord.gg/cZ2gBRZvwW))

Those are the two places where I actually see messages. GitHub issues don't give me notifications so I don't see/respond usually. **I'm doing finals through 17 December, so please be patient with long delays**

### Future Tweaks and Updates
- \[Erika 0.x-beta] Lots of features, probably? + Saily support
- \[Peep Reborn 1.1] Full rewrite + add preferences. *Might* do another rewrite in Swift later lol
- \[Reverie 2.5] Significantly faster wakeup + improved efficiency for the hibernation view
- \[Safe MainRepo 1.1] Add a much better method of blocking MR malware
- \[Satella 2.6] Add option to use SatellaObserver (theoretically higher success rate + fix double purchase bug)
- \[Shamak] Small jailbreak detection bypass written partially in Orion. *This won't be as good as liberty/flyjbx/hestia, I'm just making it for fun*
- \[Vivy 1.4] Performance improvements
- \[Vivy 1.5] Add option to have a second overlay image that is not modfied by battery level
