### About Me
Just a random iOS hacker who really (凄く) loves Emilia. I also like the When They Cry series, DDLC, and black tea. Almost everything you'll see here is related to tweak development for iOS 13-14. Also, here is a red truth for you:

### Contact Me
- [u/paisseon](https://reddit.com/u/paisseon) on Reddit
- EMT#0001 on Discord ([join CyPwn!](https://discord.gg/cZ2gBRZvwW))

Those are the two places where I actually see messages. GitHub issues don't give me notifications so I don't see/respond usually. Please understand that due to work, college, and possible timezone differences I may respond at weird times or after a long delay (usually less than 48 hours).

*I'm taking a short break from social media. I still see notifications from Discord mentions but please only ping me if something is important.*

### Future Tweaks and Updates
