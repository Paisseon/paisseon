### About Me
Just a random iOS hacker who really (凄く) loves Emilia. I also like the When They Cry series, DDLC, and black tea. Almost everything you'll see here is related to tweak development for iOS 13-14. Also, here is a red truth for you:

### Contact Me
- [u/paisseon](https://reddit.com/u/paisseon) on Reddit
- EMT#0001 on Discord ([join CyPwn!](https://discord.gg/cZ2gBRZvwW))

Those are the two places where I actually see messages. GitHub issues don't give me notifications so I don't see/respond usually. Please understand that due to work, college, and possible timezone differences I may respond at weird times or after a long delay (usually less than 48 hours).

### Future Tweaks and Updates
- \[Carmilla] A video wallpaper tweak that I tried and very much failed to write in Swift. Will be written in Objective-C.
- \[CyDown++ 7.1.6] Renaming 7.1.5 for those who didn't hear that I release it too early by accident. This will be what 7.1.5 was supposed to be. Includes my own AES256 encryption library too :)
- \[LunarTime] Show the lunar phase next to the time label in status bar
- \[Vivy 1.3] Add option to choose battery fill colours
- \[Vivy 1.4?] Add option to have a second overlay image that is not modfied by battery level
- \[WithholdingCalculator] Speculative calculator tweak whenever more important things are done
