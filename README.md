### Contact Me
- [u/paisseon](https://reddit.com/u/paisseon) on Reddit
- EMT#0001 on Discord ([join CyPwn!](https://discord.gg/cZ2gBRZvwW))

Those are the two places where I actually see messages. GitHub issues don't give me notifications so I don't see/respond usually. **I'm doing finals through 17 December, so please be patient with long delays**

### Future Tweaks and Updates
- \[Erika 0.3-beta] Full rewrite in Swift + SwiftUI-- *possible* Saily support in 0.4-beta?
- \[Vivy 1.3] Considering a Swift rewrite. Maybe.
