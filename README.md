### About Me
Hey, I'm Paisseon, that one hacker who occasionally makes release posts on r/jb_. I'm a weeb (could you tell?) who likes Re:Zero, the When They Cry series, DDLC, Madoka Magica, and a lot of other things that would be too long to list. My primary focus is iOS 13-14 tweak development.

### Contact Me
- [u/paisseon](https://reddit.com/u/paisseon) on Reddit
- EMT#2175 on Discord ([join CyPwn!](https://discord.gg/cZ2gBRZvwW))

Those are the two places where I actually see messages. GitHub issues don't give me notifications so I don't see/respond usually. Please understand that due to work, college, and possible timezone differences I may respond at weird times or after a long delay.

### Currently in Development
- \[Argyle] Initial release. Better than Redeb. A somewhat different approach from Debra on [Sudo's repo](https://sudocat-dev.github.io/repo).
- \[CustomPass] Initial release. It lets you choose whatever symbols you want for the passcode. Does not actually change passcode, just the symbols.
- \[CyDown++] Add Cydia compatiblity.
- \[Raida] Initial release. Enable Apple's built-in multitasking features on iPhone
- \[Reverie] Add option to disable Reverie when device is charging.
- \[Satella] Scrap the old server-sided receipt faker, add a local, pure ObjC one.
- \[Vivy] Completely change theme selection because the current way sucks. This new one allows you to use a custom battery icon straight from the preferences.
