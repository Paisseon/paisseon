### About Me
Amateur iOS tweak developer who reaaaallllyyy loves Emilia. You're probably here because of Satella or CyDown++, or if the smoothbrains on r/jb are trying to mock me again for... *reads notes*... copying a copy of a copy of an idea. Intellectual property is fake btw, seize the digital means of production üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

Note to the aforementioned smoothbrains: I am not anti-developer, I just believe fervently that people deserve equal right to software. Oh, and I'm not a Litten alt either, she is 100x better than I could ever be.

### Contact Me
- [u/paisseon](https://reddit.com/u/paisseon) on Reddit
- EMT#0001 on Discord ([join CyPwn!](https://discord.gg/cZ2gBRZvwW))

Those are the two places where I actually see messages. GitHub issues don't give me notifications so I don't see/respond usually. Please understand that due to work, college, and possible timezone differences I may respond at weird times or after a long delay (usually less than 48 hours).

### Future Tweaks and Updates
- \[CrackMe] Somewhat realistic tweak for beginners to crack. I might make a simple walkthrough as well
- \[CyDown++ 7.2] This update will mix CyDown++'s improvements with my own replacement for it that works on Sileo and has a prettier UI
- \[Satella 2.6] Add option to use SatellaObserver (theoretically higher success rate + fix double purchase bug)
- \[Vivy 1.4] Add option to have a second overlay image that is not modfied by battery level
