### Contact Me
- [u/paisseon](https://reddit.com/u/paisseon) on Reddit
- EMT#0001 on Discord ([join CyPwn!](https://discord.gg/cZ2gBRZvwW))

Those are the two places where I actually see messages. ~~GitHub issues don't give me notifications so I don't see/respond usually.~~ Ok I figured out that the blue dot means an issue üòÖ My apologies to people from months ago who have no responses on their issues
