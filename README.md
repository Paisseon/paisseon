### Actively Updated 🆕
- Erika
- Ishtar
- Satella / Satella Jailed
- Violyn

### To-Do List 🗒
- 「Satella Series」 Rewrite using Jinx so Orion needn't be injected
- 「Satella Jailed」 Attempt to make a TrollStore-based decrypter with option to inject SatellaJailed
- 「Ishtar」         Attempt to make Ishtar work jailed? Idk if it's possible
- 「StarForge」      Successor to KOTOR 1 Mod Manager, will (eventually) include K2 support
- 「Violyn」         Optimise the UI for its respective platforms and also fix some bad code
- 「Reverie」        Try to add requested features, i.e., muting alarms and throttling CPU
- 「Butterfly」      SwiftUI status bar. May or may not bother finishing (at least not soon)
