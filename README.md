### Actively Updated 🆕
- Butterfly (upcoming?)
- Erika
- Long Time Sunshine (upcoming, this is just codename it will change, probably my last crack)
- Phonewave (name subject to change) (upcoming?, "name subject to change" is just part of the name)
- Satella / Satella Jailed
- Traya (upcoming)
- Violyn

### To-Do List 🗒
- 「Traya」     Successor to KOTOR 1 Mod Manager, will include K2 support
- 「Satella」   Make Satella work with TrollStore (no Jailed needed). Idk if it's even possible tho
- 「Reverie」   Try to add requested features, i.e., muting alarms and throttling CPU
- 「Butterfly」 SwiftUI status bar. May or may not bother finishing (at least not soon)
- 「Phonewave」 An idea in my head that may or may not ever be realised
