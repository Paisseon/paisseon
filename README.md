### About Me
Just a random iOS hacker who really (凄く) loves Emilia. I also like the When They Cry series, DDLC, and black tea. Almost everything you'll see here is related to tweak development for iOS 13-14. Also, here is a red truth for you:

### Contact Me
- [u/paisseon](https://reddit.com/u/paisseon) on Reddit
- EMT#0001 on Discord ([join CyPwn!](https://discord.gg/cZ2gBRZvwW))

Those are the two places where I actually see messages. GitHub issues don't give me notifications so I don't see/respond usually. Please understand that due to work, college, and possible timezone differences I may respond at weird times or after a long delay (usually less than 48 hours).

### Future Tweaks and Updates
- \[All Tweaks] Depictions for non-Sileo package managers. Thanks to Bryce!
- \[Carmilla 1.0] A video wallpaper tweak written in Swift/Orion. Haven't even started but I intend to make this at some point.
- \[CCCalc 2.0.2] Making a better fix with less bugs, I suppose.
- \[CustomPass 1.0] Change the passcode numbers to whatever symbols you want. This might take a while as the other things here are higher priority.
- \[DarkKeysReborn 1.3] Full rewrite, probably won't add anything new but the code was awful.
- \[Pandora 1.0] Coming soon? Multitasking tweaks are hard to make, but it will eventually be released in some form.
- \[Reverie 2.3] Fix bugs in the CPU throttling and in the "Hibernate Whilst Charging" toggle.
- \[Satella 2.5.1] Group the receipt faker so it only hooks SKPaymentTransaction.transactionReceipt when enabled
- \[Vivy 1.3] Add option for Eliza-style colouring.
