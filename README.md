### About Me ✨
> She never could learn or understand anything before she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was often inattentive, and occasionally stupid. - Jane Austen, *Northanger Abbey*

Hello! I'm an iOS tweak developer with an interest in software liberation (Ahoy! 🏴‍☠️) and getting lost in stories (I usually find my way out). I mostly code in Swift, but can do ObjC when needed. School and work keep me pretty busy, so updates may be sparse outside of summer months!
