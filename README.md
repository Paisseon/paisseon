### About Me ✨
> She never could learn or understand anything before she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was often inattentive, and occasionally stupid. - Jane Austen, *Northanger Abbey*

Hello! I'm an iOS tweak developer with an interest in software liberation (Ahoy! 🏴‍☠️) and getting lost in stories (I usually find my way out). Mostly code in Swift. Summer holiday is my only large block of free time, so updates are sparse outside of that.

### Contact Me ✉️
For fastest replies, ping me on Discord/Matrix during a weekend. I also see Reddit DMs, but not Reddit Chat or Discord DM.
